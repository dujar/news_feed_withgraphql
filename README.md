A tutorial that helps understand graphql as a query language and not a database language like I previoulsy thought.
The easiness of adopting the language and incorporating it with the REACT framework is a major part of why I will adopt this language in order to fetch the data for my views.

As it is my first tutorial I can only say that the logic to adopt graphql is if you want to receive and fetch the the right data, no over or underfetching. The resolvers do the dirty work to get the fields right when requested. It abstracts away the patching of the data when receiving it.
We can still use redux or mobx if we want to cache in the data.
